# gst-textrollup

A GStreamer text filter that turns timestamped word-level text into a fixed
roll-up caption window. Completed lines freeze; only the bottom line grows:

```text
transcribecpptranscriber ! textrollup ! fakesink
```

The element is `textrollup`; the plugin is `textrollup`. It is designed to sit
after a speech-to-text element such as
[gst-transcribe-cpp](https://github.com/darfink/gst-transcribe-cpp), or after
any source that emits timestamped `text/x-raw,format=utf8` buffers.

It is built for live captioning, where the viewer is reading the text while it
is still being written. Two properties follow from that, and between them they
account for most of the design:

- **Nothing already on screen moves.** A line's text is decided once, when it
  fills, and is never recomputed.
- **A state is emitted the moment input commits**, rather than batched toward a
  sentence boundary. The element adds no formatter latency.

In the position it is meant for it replaces `textaccumulate` + `textwrap`,
because owning the line breaking is precisely what makes the first property
possible.

## How cues are built up

One buffer in, one word. One buffer out, the whole visible window. Feeding it
`one of the things that's great about filming this here is that we get to see
the work happening` at `columns=42 lines=2`, one word every 240 ms:

```text
00:00.000 --> 00:00.240   one
00:00.240 --> 00:00.480   one of
00:00.480 --> 00:00.720   one of the
00:00.720 --> 00:00.960   one of the things
00:00.960 --> 00:01.200   one of the things that's
00:01.200 --> 00:01.440   one of the things that's great
00:01.440 --> 00:01.680   one of the things that's great about     <- line is full
00:01.680 --> 00:01.920   one of the things that's great about     <- frozen from
                          filming                                     here on
00:01.920 --> 00:02.160   one of the things that's great about
                          filming this
             (this here is that we get to, one word per cue)
00:03.600 --> 00:03.840   one of the things that's great about
                          filming this here is that we get to see
00:03.840 --> 00:04.080   filming this here is that we get to see  <- scrolled up,
                          the                                         unchanged
00:04.080 --> 00:04.320   filming this here is that we get to see
                          the work
00:04.320 --> 00:04.570   filming this here is that we get to see
                          the work happening
```

`one of the things that's great about` is decided at 00:01.440 and is
byte-identical in every later cue until it scrolls off at 00:03.840.

Each output carries the **entire** visible window as a replacement state and
preserves the input buffer's PTS and duration exactly. Lifecycle is explicit:
the state remains active until another state or an empty clear replaces it.

### Why not wrap the text instead

Because wrapping is a global decision and roll-up needs a local one. Once the
visible text fills the window, re-wrapping means re-wrapping a *sliding*
window, and the line breaks move. The same words, re-wrapped on each new word:

```text
was:  of the things that's great, Satya, about
now:  that's great, Satya, about filming this
```

`filming this` has jumped from the bottom line up onto the line above. That
happens several times a second and reads as the whole caption twitching.
`textrollup` never re-wraps, so it cannot happen.

## Build

Requires Rust 1.92+ and GStreamer 1.20 development headers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darfink/gst-textrollup
cd gst-textrollup
cargo build --release
```

Expose the plugin to GStreamer and confirm that it registered:

```bash
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH="$PWD/target/release"
gst-inspect-1.0 textrollup
```

To install it permanently, copy
`target/release/libgsttextrollup.so` (`.dylib` on macOS) into a GStreamer plugin
directory.

## Try it

The most useful smoke test combines it with
[gst-transcribe-cpp](https://github.com/darfink/gst-transcribe-cpp) and a GGUF
model. After installing or exposing both plugins to GStreamer, run:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=speech.wav ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioresample \
  ! transcribecpptranscriber mode=stream backend=cpu \
      model-path=nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b-Q8_0.gguf \
  ! textrollup columns=42 lines=2 clear-after=3000 \
  ! fakesink dump=true
```

The transcriber supplies one committed word per timestamped buffer and GAP
events during silence. `textrollup` emits complete rendered windows as text
buffers, so the dump contains captions such as:

```text
one of the things
that is great
```

The output buffer carries the window text, its media PTS, and its duration.
Timeline holes are represented by downstream GAP events.

### Docker

The image builds and registers the filter without requiring a local Rust or
GStreamer development toolchain:

```bash
docker build -t gst-textrollup .
docker run --rm gst-textrollup
```

The default command runs `gst-inspect-1.0 textrollup`. The image contains this
filter only; speech recognition, audio fixtures, and models are intentionally
left to the companion transcriber image or to a host pipeline.

## Window behaviour

A line is completed either by filling to `columns` or by sentence-final
punctuation when `break-on-sentence` is set, and is fixed byte-for-byte from
that moment until it scrolls out of the window. Width is Unicode display width,
so wide CJK characters count as two columns, and a single word longer than
`columns` gets a line to itself rather than being broken mid-word.

`columns`, `lines` and `break-on-sentence` are writable while playing, but they
affect future wrapping only: lines that are already frozen keep the geometry
they were built with, since un-freezing them is the one thing this element
exists to avoid.

The element accepts one or more committed words per buffer. It processes every
word but emits only the final complete window, so the one-input/one-output
contract is retained. Non-empty buffers must contain valid UTF-8 and have a PTS
and non-zero duration. An empty UTF-8 buffer is an explicit clear at its PTS.

## Silence and timing

The element uses media-time GAP events rather than a wall-clock timer:

| Property | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `clear-after` | 3000 ms | Media-time silence after the previous input end before an explicit clear; `0` never clears |

When a GAP crosses `last_input_end + clear-after`, the element splits the GAP,
emits one zero-duration empty UTF-8 buffer at that exact media timestamp, and
resets its internal window. A later word performs the same missed-clear check
if upstream omitted GAP events. No wall-clock timer or HLS cadence participates.

Upstream should announce silence with GAP events so the clear is published
while silence is in progress. If it does not, the first later word still emits
the missed clear at the original media-time deadline before starting a clean
window.

## Properties

| Property | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `columns` | 42 | Maximum display width per line |
| `lines` | 2 | Number of lines in the roll-up window |
| `clear-after` | 3000 ms | Media-time silence after the last input end before clearing; `0` disables clearing |
| `break-on-sentence` | `true` | Finish the current line at `.`, `!`, `?`, or `…`, including trailing quotes/brackets |

### Announcing the clear

The empty buffer at `clear-after` is authoritative. Replacement-state
transports such as FLV script data consume it as “stop displaying”; downstream
packagers must not invent another timeout. Setting `clear-after=0` delegates
the lifecycle to an explicit empty input instead.

All properties are readable and writable through the PAUSED and PLAYING states.

## Integration contract

The sink and source pads both carry:

```text
text/x-raw, format=utf8
```

Every input buffer must have a timestamp. Non-empty buffers also require a
non-zero duration. The element forwards stream-start,
segment, flush, and relevant custom downstream events. A new segment clears the
caption window so text from the previous timeline cannot leak into the new one.

The element reports upstream latency unchanged; formatting contributes no
additional latency.

## Debugging

```bash
GST_DEBUG=textrollup:6 gst-launch-1.0 ...
```

Logs include GAP splitting, clear positions, rendered state, and diagnostics
for missing timing or invalid UTF-8.

## Tests

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets
```

The suite covers the pure roll-up window, a fixture oracle, immediate output,
exact timing preservation, media-time clearing, missed GAP recovery, flush,
zero formatter latency, multi-word buffers, punctuation/width scrolling, and
fixation of completed lines.

## Status and limitations

The word-window and GStreamer state machine are covered by unit and harness
tests. The filter has also been exercised after `gst-transcribe-cpp` on speech
and speech/silence/speech fixtures.

The timing tests are hand-written invariant probes rather than a complete
reference oracle for every combination of words, GAPs, seeks, and dynamic
property changes. In particular, upstream timestamp/GAP quality remains part
of the integration contract.
